### Employee Attrition

This GitHub repository hosts a Jupyter notebook titled attrition.ipynb, focusing on analyzing employee attrition. The notebook is structured into distinct parts, each aimed at handling different aspects of the analysis process.

#### Overview

The notebook is designed to explore and model employee attrition based on various factors. It is divided into several key sections, each addressing a critical steps in the data analysis.

#### Structure

- Part 1: Preprocessing - This section is dedicated to preparing the data for analysis. It includes encoding and scaling the data to make the data suitable for modeling.

- Model Creation, Compilation, and Training - Here, the notebook involves setting up a nerual network, compiling it with appropriate metrics and optimizers, and training it on the preprocessed data.

- Summary - The notebook concludes with a summary section where critical questions regarding the analysis are answered. These include discussions on the choice of metrics, activation functions, and potential improvements for the model.

#### Questions Section

1. The appropriateness of accuracy as a metric for this analysis.
2. The choice of activation functions for the output layers and the rationale behind these choices.
3. Suggestions for improving the model further.

#### Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the attrition.ipynb file directly.
3. Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment.
4. Execute the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis or modify it for your dataset.
